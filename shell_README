PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

shellby\fR \- simple UNIX command interpreter

Shellby\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.

Invocation
.in +2n
\fBShellby\fR can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by \fIisatty(3)\fR), an \fIinteractive\fR shell is opened.
When executing interactively, \fBshellby\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when it is ready to read a command.

Alternatively, if command line arguments are supplied upon invocation, \fBshellby\fR treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands.
The supplied file should contain one command per line.
.B Shellby\fR runs each of the commands contained in the file in order before exiting.

. Environment - Upon invocation, \fBshellby\fR receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was exeucted.

This \fBenvironment\fR is an array of \fIname-value\fR strings describing variables in the format \fINAME=VALUE\fR.

Command Execution - After receiving a command, \fBshellby\fR tokenizes it into words using \fB" "\fR as a delimiter.
The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command.

Shellby\fR will also proceeds with the following actions:


A. If the first character of the command is neither a slash (\fI\\\fR) nor dot (\fI.\fR), the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.
If a shell builtin has the name, then the builtin is invoked.

B. If the first character of the command is none of a slash (\fI\\\fR), dot (\fI.\fR), nor builtin, \fBshellby\fR searches each element of the
\fBPATH\fR environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by specified name.

C. If the first character of the command is a slash (\fI\\\fR) or dot (\fI.\fR) or either of the above searches was successful,
the shell executes the named program with any remaining arguments given in a separate execution environment.

. Exit Status - Shellby\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure.

The return status is 127 if the command is found; if the found command is not executable, the return status is 126.

. All builtins return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage (indicated by a corresponding error message).

. While running in interactive mode, \fBshellby\fR ignores the keyboard input \fBCtrl+c\fR.
Alternatively, an input of end-of-file (\fBCtrl+d\fR) will exit the program.

Variable Replacement - Shellby\fR inerprets the \fI$\fR character for variable replacement
 $ENV_VARIABLE\fR\fIENV_VARIABLE\fR is subsituted with its value.
 $?\fR\fI?\fR is substituted with the return value of the last program executed.

The second \fI$\fR is substituted with the current process ID.
.RE

. Comments - Shellby\fR ignores all words and characters preceeded by a \fI#\fR character on a line.
.in

. Commands separated by a \fI;\fR are executed sequentially.


. command1\fR && \fIcommand2\fR: \fIcommand2\fR is executed if, and only if, \fIcommand1\fR returns an exit status of zero.

logical operator - command1\fR || \fIcommand2\fR: \fIcommand2\fR is executed if, and only if, \fIcommand1\fR returns a non-zero exit status.

The operators \fI&&\fR and \fI||\fR have equal precedence, followed by \fI;\fR.

. Shellby Builtin Commands

Usage: .B cd [DIRECTORY]

Changes the current directory of the process to \fBDIRECTORY\fR.

If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as \fBcd $HOME\fR.

If the argument \fB-\fR is given, the command is interpreted as \fBcd $OLDPWD\fR.

The environment variables \fBPWD\fR and \fBOLDPWD\fR are updated after a change of directory.

alias

Usage: \fBalias [NAME[='VALUE'] ...]\fR

Handles aliases - alias\fR: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form \fINAME='VALUE'\fR.

.I alias NAME [NAME2 ...]\fR: Prints the aliases \fINAME\fR, \fINAME2\fR, etc. one per line, in the form \fINAME='VALUE'\fR.

.I alias NAME='VALUE' [...]\fR: Defines an alias for each \fINAME\fR whose \fIVALUE\fR is given.
If \fIname\fR is already an alias, its value is replaced with \fIVALUE\fR.

Exits the shell - The \fBSTATUS\fR argument is the integer used to exit the shell.

If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as \fBexit 0\fR

env - Prints the current environment.

setenv - Initializes a new environment variable, or modifies an existing one

unsetenv: Removes an environmental variable.

access(2), chdir(2), execve(2), _exit(2), exit(3), fflush(3), fork(2), free(3), isatty(3), getcwd(3), malloc(3), open(2), read(2), sh(1), signal(2), stat(2), wait(2), write(2)

.B Shellby\fR emulates basic functionality of the \fBsh\fR shell.
This man page emulates from the corresponding man pages sh(1) and dash(1).
